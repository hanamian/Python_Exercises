# Division Result in Int and Float Type
**TASK:**
Make 2 variables with 2 different integer values, then do one division by the other. Give 2 results with different data types, **integer** and **float**!

**ANSWER**
```python
a = 100
b = 20
c = a/b
print('Int type result= ',int(c))
print('Float type result= ',float(c))
```
**The result must be**
```python
Int type result =  5
Float type result =  5.0
```
