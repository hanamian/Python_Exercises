# Division Result in Int and Float Type
**TASK:**
Make 2 variables with 2 different integer values, then do one division by the other. Give 2 results with different data types, **integer** and **float**!

### Answer
```python
a = 100
b = 20
c = a/b
print('Int type result= ',int(c))
print('Float type result= ',float(c))
```
### The result must be:
```python
Int type result=  5 #this is the int result
Float type result=  5.0 #this is the float result
```
